	<h3>Dolch List</h3>
	<p>
		The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolch_word_list">Dolch word list</a> is a list of
		220 “service words” and separate list of 95 nouns created by Edward William Dolch,
		a major proponent of the “whole-word” method of beginning reading instruction.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Dolch word list is a list of frequently used English words (also known as sight words),
		compiled by Edward William Dolch, a major proponent of the "whole-word" method of beginning reading instruction.
		The list was first published in a journal article in 1936 (“A Basic Sight Vocabulary”
		- <i>The Elementary School Journal</i>, vol. 36, no. 6, 1936, pp.456-460.)
		and then published in his book <i>Problems in Reading</i> in 1948.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dolch compiled the list based on children's books of his era,
		which is why nouns such as "kitty" and "Santa Claus" appear on the list instead of more current high-frequency words.
		The list contains 220 “service words” that Dolch thought should be easily recognized in order to
		achieve reading fluency in the English language. The compilation excludes nouns,
		which comprise a separate 95-word list. According to Dolch, between 50% and 75% of all words used in schoolbooks,
		library books, newspapers, and magazines are a part of the Dolch basic sight word vocabulary.
		However, bear in mind that he compiled this list in 1936.

		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America">Voice of America</a> (VOA).

	</p>
	<p>
		According to a researcher (sic) at Cambridge University, it doesn't matter in what order the letters in a word are,
		the only important thing is that the first and last letter be at the right place.
		The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without problem.
		This is because the human mind does not read every letter by itself but the word as a whole.
